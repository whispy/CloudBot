17:09:07 <TheWhisper> Dekthro, can you kill your bot for now?
17:09:12 <Dekthro> Ya
17:09:16 <Dekthro> Windows =/= Linux
17:09:19 <TheWhisper> Obviously
17:09:45 <TheWhisper> We should just get a cheap digitalocean instance
17:09:52 <Dekthro> I'm sure it just works fine on Fedora, I just need to figurin
17:09:53 <TheWhisper> would be like less than a dollar from each
17:10:11 <Dekthro> Yeah I'm not paying when I can just do it on the dime I'm already spending to run this
17:10:14 <Dekthro> But you can if you want :p
17:10:19 <TheWhisper> meh
17:10:32 <TheWhisper> I think we should try to stick with the cloudbot
17:10:39 <TheWhisper> because it's 1) still actively developed
17:10:44 <TheWhisper> and 2) got lots of plugins
17:10:54 <TheWhisper> So try to figure it out for Fedora
17:10:54 <Dekthro> Yeah it has af uck load
17:10:57 <TheWhisper> and if you can't
17:11:01 <TheWhisper> then we'll decide what to do from there

17:16:17 <Dekthro> I'm sure it's somethign dumb and simple
17:16:44 <TheWhisper> hm
17:16:52 <Dekthro> i just dont know enough about linux in general yet
17:16:52 <TheWhisper> Looks like you can get a very simple heroku instance for free
17:17:07 <conlinism> yep
17:17:13 <conlinism> thats why I am using it
17:17:24 <TheWhisper> Conlinism, but it then says $.05/dyno hour
17:17:32 <TheWhisper> but it also says estimated monthly cost = free
17:17:54 <conlinism> yeah, it doesnt cost me anything to run 1 instance
17:17:59 <TheWhisper> ah
17:18:28 <TheWhisper> I'll check it out now

17:29:16 <conlinism> youre on windows?
17:29:19 <TheWhisper> yes
17:29:21 <conlinism> eww
17:29:23 <conlinism> ok
17:29:24 <TheWhisper> Do I need virtualenv locally?
17:29:32 <conlinism> so wait
17:29:34 <TheWhisper> Like do I need to mirror the directories locally or something?
17:29:38 <conlinism> you are sshed into heroku?
17:29:47 <TheWhisper> Ah
17:29:52 <TheWhisper> I think I need to mirror it locally
17:30:04 <conlinism> http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/
17:30:15 <conlinism> http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/
17:30:19 <conlinism> sorry
17:30:22 <conlinism> meant to send this
17:30:22 <conlinism> http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/#virtualenv
17:32:04 <TheWhisper> nevermind figured it out
17:34:32 <conlinism> cool
17:35:37 <TheWhisper> Now when I run like pip or something
17:35:44 <TheWhisper> hm
17:35:54 <TheWhisper> It says command not found
17:35:58 <TheWhisper> even though I have it installed
17:36:20 <conlinism> can you run a virtual machine with linux?
17:36:25 <TheWhisper> Don't want to
17:36:26 <conlinism> this is going to be a pain with windows
17:36:27 <conlinism> lol
17:37:17 <TheWhisper> I hate how the console disappears if there's an error
17:37:24 <TheWhisper> How the fuck am I supposed to fix the error then -.-
17:37:24 <conlinism> yeah
17:37:41 <conlinism> windows is really not built for development
17:37:47 <conlinism> without some heavy tweaking
17:38:45 <TheWhisper> Okay, figured out how to get it to stay
17:41:16 <EDSGD> http://payload245.cargocollective.com/1/0/31246/7205053/Raf%20Simons%20SS14%20Menswear%20%20THIRD%20LOOKS.png
17:44:02 <TheWhisper> Okay, got pip and stuff to work in the regular console
17:44:08 <TheWhisper> Not in the Heroku one
17:45:53 <zelke> ugh, nothing like getting low-balled for a freelance project 
17:46:07 <TheWhisper> okay, got it working for now, conlinism
